    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Shiro is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from powdered chickpeas or
      broad bean flour, cooked with spices and sometimes mixed with onions,
      garlic, and berbere (a spice blend). It is typically served as a thick,
      flavorful stew that is enjoyed with injera, a type of sourdough flatbread.
      Shiro is a staple in Ethiopian cuisine and is loved for its rich taste and
      comforting texture.
